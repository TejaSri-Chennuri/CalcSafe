# Invisible SOS Mode - Web Prototype

## Description

This web prototype showcases the concept of an "Invisible SOS Mode," a discreet method to alert trusted contacts during emergencies where openly seeking help is unsafe or impossible. It simulates key features of a potential mobile application, including:

* **PIN-based SOS trigger:** Activate the SOS alert secretly by entering "999=" in a calculator interface.
* **Voice code simulation:** Trigger the SOS alert by speaking a predefined phrase ("help red book").
* **Shake pattern simulation:** Simulate a shake pattern (Left, Right, Left) using on-screen buttons.
* **Trusted contacts (simulation):** Add and manage a simulated list of trusted contacts.
* **Visual feedback:** Receive clear visual cues (red background) when the SOS is activated.

This prototype is intended to demonstrate the "Invisible SOS Mode" concept and is not a fully functional application.

## How to Use (Local)

1.  **Download the Project:** Download the project files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, images folder) from this GitHub repository.
2.  **Open the Application:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Calculator:** Use the calculator interface for basic calculations.
4.  **Secret SOS Trigger:** Enter "999=" and press "=" to secretly trigger the SOS alert. The background will turn red.
5.  **Settings:** Click the "Settings" button to access the settings overlay.
6.  **Trusted Contacts:** In the settings overlay, add simulated trusted contacts using the provided form.
7.  **Voice Code Simulation:** Click "Start Recording" and speak a phrase containing "help red book" to simulate voice code detection.
8.  **Shake Pattern Simulation:** Click the "Left," "Right," and "Left" buttons in that sequence to simulate the shake pattern.
9.  **Visual Feedback:** Observe the red background when the SOS is triggered.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Web Speech API (for voice code simulation)

## Future Improvements

* Real-world mobile application development (React Native, Flutter).
* Integration with location services and SMS/push notifications.
* Enhanced security and privacy features.
* Improved user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
* Implementation of real accelerometer data for shake detection.
* Testing on real devices.
